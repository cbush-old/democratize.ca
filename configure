  In order to get the error handlers to work, run this file.
  
  You will need to override the PUBLIC_ROOT definition in
  the config.php file if "http://yourlocalhost/" does not =
  "thisdirectory/public/".
  
  Make a file called config.local.php with the following:
  
  <?php
  define("PUBLIC_ROOT","/some/path/thisdirectory/public");
  
  
  Unless your PUBLIC_ROOT is / (in which case you don't need
  to override this at all), PUBLIC_ROOT must have a slash(/) 
  at the beginning and must NOT have one at the end.
